# Ojibwe-Prompt-Generator
## This is a random generator to help quiz yourself on basic verb conjugation

The original library of words is in Nishnaabe and English, but please feel free to add your own libraries. I'm working on making it flexible enough to handle multiple languages and grammar aspects.

Please enjoy! :)
